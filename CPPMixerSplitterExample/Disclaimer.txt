CO-LaN nor AmsterCHEM claim that this example is fit for purpose. 
CO-LaN nor AmsterCHEM claim that this example implements
this Unit Operation in an efficient way; in the contrary, in order
to keep the example readible, no attempt is made to cache allocated
variables (such as strings, arrays, ...) or to provide efficient
lookup methods (e.g. for items in collections, ...)

AmsterCHEM be held liable for consequential or any other damages
